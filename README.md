# arabscoin

ARABS Token was created to provide the initial capital needed to set up and develop a platform on the Binance smart grids. This token can be converted into any of the popular cryptocurrencies in the decentralized PancakeSwap Exchange, and we intend to get it into more centralized and decentralized exchanges. Yet, this is not our only goal of creating the token and will also use it in the platform as a local currency to buy services.
